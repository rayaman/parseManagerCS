ParseManagerCS Version!
TODO:
- [ ] Allow the use of functions in arguments (Tough)
- [ ] Allow the use of statements in conditionals: `if num+5>=GETAGE()-1 then STOP(song)|SKIP(0)` (Tough)
- [ ] Add other cool built in things (Fun)
- [ ] Add object support (Tough)
- [ ] Improve audio support (Simple)
- [x] Add simple threading (Alright)
- [ ] Fix Bugs! (Death)

Maybe:
- [ ] Add While/for loops (With labels this can easily be done. So it isn't really needed, I may add it in the future though!)
